### Plan
- [ ] Modify the `Game` struct to hide the dealer's second card.
- [ ] Update the `NewGame` function to reflect this change.
- [ ] Adjust the `standHandler` to reveal the dealer's card and play the dealer's turn.
- [ ] Update the `script.js` to only show the dealer's visible card.
- [ ] Commit and push the changes.
- [ ] Post a comment on the PR with the changes.
