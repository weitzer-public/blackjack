I've looked into the history of the changes for this pull request, and I can clarify how the issues related to "double downs" and "blackjack payouts" were addressed.

### Blackjack Payouts

You are correct to point out that the blackjack payout was an issue. I apologize for the miscommunication, but it appears that **the blackjack payout has not been fixed yet**. The logic in `game.go` still pays out at 2:1 instead of the standard 3:2. I have updated my plan to reflect that this is still an outstanding issue.

### Double Downs

The issue with "double downs" was not a bug in the game logic itself, but rather an issue with code duplication in the frontend. The original code had separate `fetch` calls for "hit," "stand," and "double down" that were all very similar.

This was fixed by refactoring the frontend code in `frontend/script.js` to use a single helper function called `performAction`. This function handles all API calls to the backend, which has reduced the amount of duplicated code and made the frontend easier to maintain.

I hope this clears things up. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
