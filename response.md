I have addressed the bugs found in the recent code review. Here is a list of the bugs and a description of how I solved them:

### Bugs Fixed

1.  **No Multiplayer Support:** The game was previously single-player.
    *   **Fix:** I updated the backend to support one human and four AI players. This involved:
        *   Modifying the `Game` and `Player` structs in `game.go` to handle multiple players.
        *   Implementing turn-based logic and a simple AI strategy for the computer players.
        *   Updating the frontend in `index.html` and `script.js` to display all players and their game state.

2.  **Flawed Blackjack Payout Test:** The test for the 3:2 blackjack payout was not correctly implemented.
    *   **Fix:** I rewrote the `TestBlackjackPayout` in `game_test.go` to accurately test the 3:2 payout for any player who gets a blackjack, ensuring the payout logic is correct.

3.  **Incomplete `determineWinner` Logic:** The winner determination logic was not robust enough for all scenarios.
    *   **Fix:** I refactored the `determineWinner` function in `game.go` to correctly handle all win, loss, and push conditions for all players, including scenarios with multiple players and blackjacks.

4.  **Incomplete "Split" and "Double Down" Features:** These features were not fully implemented.
    *   **Fix:** I completed the implementation of the "Split" and "Double Down" features in `game.go`, ensuring they work correctly within the new multi-player game flow.

5.  **Build Error:** The Go build was failing due to an incorrect integer-to-string conversion.
    *   **Fix:** I corrected the code in `game.go` to use `strconv.Itoa` for the conversion, which resolved the build error.

I have reviewed the PR and I am confident that all the bugs identified during the code review have been addressed.
