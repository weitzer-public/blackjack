### Plan to Create PRD for "Las Vegas Experience"

1.  **Define the Core Experience:** I will document the desired "Las Vegas" feel, focusing on:
    *   **Visuals and Sound:** Specify the need for a more immersive experience with high-quality graphics, animations, and sound effects that mimic a real casino.
    *   **Game Rules:** Define the specific Blackjack rules to be used, such as dealer behavior (stand on 17, hit on soft 17), player options (double down, split, surrender), and payouts (3:2 for Blackjack).
    *   **User Interface:** Design a UI that is both visually appealing and easy to use, incorporating elements of a real Blackjack table.

2.  **Flesh out the PRD:** I will create a detailed PRD document that includes:
    *   **Introduction:** A brief overview of the project and its goals.
    *   **User Stories:** Descriptions of how different users will interact with the application.
    *   **Functional Requirements:** A detailed list of all the features and functionality that the application must have.
    *   **Non-Functional Requirements:** A list of all the non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, and usability.
    *   **Wireframes and Mockups:** Visual representations of the application's UI.

3.  **Review and Refine:** I will share the PRD with stakeholders for feedback and revise as needed.
