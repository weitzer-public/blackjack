I have addressed the bugs found in the code review. Here is a summary of the fixes:

### Bugs Fixed:

1.  **No Multi-player Support:** The game was previously single-player.
    *   **Solution:** I updated the backend to support multiple players (1 human, 4 AI). This involved:
        *   Modifying the `Game` struct in `game.go` to manage a slice of `Player` structs.
        *   Updating the game logic to handle turns for each player.
        *   Implementing a simple AI strategy for the computer-controlled players.

2.  **Incorrect Frontend Rendering for Multi-player:** The frontend was not set up to display multiple players.
    *   **Solution:** I updated the frontend to display all players and their hands. This involved:
        *   Updating `index.html` to include a dedicated area for the other players.
        *   Modifying the `renderGame` function in `script.js` to render all players at the table.

3.  **Blackjack Payout:** The blackjack payout was previously incorrect.
    *   **Solution:** This was already fixed in a previous commit, but I have verified that the 3:2 payout is working correctly and added a test case for it.

All tests are now passing, and the changes have been pushed to the pull request.
